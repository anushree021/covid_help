 Important steps to follow:

        <p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i> Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. </p>
     <p> <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i>  If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
<p> <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i> Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
<p> <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i> Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet away from others if you must go out in public.
<p> <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i>
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and throw the tissue away after use. If a tissue isnâ€™t available, cough or sneeze into your elbow or sleeve, not your hands.
<p><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i>
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, computers, phones, keyboards, sinks, toilets, faucets and countertops. Read full CDC information. </br></p>
