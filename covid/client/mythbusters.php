<h1> Some facts and Myth-busters about COVID-19</h1>
	<div id="a">
	 <h2> 1. It is safer to frequently clean your hands and not wear gloves</h2>
		<p>Wearing gloves risks transferring germs from one surface to another and contaminating your hands when removing them. Wearing gloves does not replace cleaning hands. Health workers wear gloves only for specific tasks.</p>
		<h2>2. Can shoes spread the COVID-19 virus?</h2>
<p> The likelihood of COVID-19 being spread on shoes and infecting individuals is very low. As a precautionary measure, particularly in homes where infants and small children crawl or play on floors, consider leaving your shoes at the entrance of your home. This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste that could be carried on the soles of shoes.</p>
